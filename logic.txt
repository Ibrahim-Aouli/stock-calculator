BASIC LOGIC 

How much did the item cost?
- $__

how much did all the items cost?
- $___

how much was the total discount?
- $___

how much did you pay (MUST BE AUD)?
- $___


How much did each item cost us to buy?

step 1: 
How much did we pay for the items with the discount included? 
- discounted items cost = total items cost - total discount

step 2:
how much did we pay for the item individually? 
- discount rate (percentage) = total discount / all items cost
- item cost with discount = item cost * (1 - discount rate)

step 3:
how much extra dollars did we have to pay?
- (optional) dollar difference = total paid - discounted items cost 
how much do we multiply the discounted cost to match how much we paid?
- dollar difference rate = total paid / discounted items cost 

step 4:
how much did each item cost us to buy?
final cost of item = item cost with discount * dollar difference rate

example:

How much did the item cost?
- $10

how much did all the items cost?
- $100

how much was the total discount?
- $20

how much did you pay (MUST BE AUD)?
- $200

step 1: 
How much did we pay for the items with the discount included? 
- discounted items cost = $100 - $20 = $80

step 2:
how much did we pay for the item individually? 
- discount rate (percentage) = $20 / $100 = 0.2 = 20%
- item cost with discount = $10 * (1 - 0.2) = $10 * 0.8 = $8

step 3:
how much extra dollars did we have to pay?
- (optional) dollar difference = $200 - $80 = $120
how much do we multiply the discounted cost to match how much we paid?
- dollar difference rate = $200 / $80 = 2.5

step 4:
how much did each item cost us to buy?
final cost of item = $8 * 2.5 = $20
